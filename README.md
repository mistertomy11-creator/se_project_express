## Project Pitch Video

Check out [this video](https://www.loom.com/share/8762587628374cbcb4a02497041a4fa4), where I describe my
project and some challenges I faced while building it. This project highlights my ability to build responsive, scalable frontend applications that integrate cleanly with secure APIs, demonstrates my ability to design secure, resilient backend systems ready for production.”

# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. You’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
